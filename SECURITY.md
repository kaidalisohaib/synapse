# Security Measures - Synapse Platform

## Email Verification Security

### Problem Identified
The original resend verification implementation had a security vulnerability where:
- Anyone could trigger email verification for any email address
- This could potentially be used for email enumeration attacks
- Malicious users could spam others with verification emails

### Security Solution Implemented

#### **Simple & Secure Approach: Email Address Lock**
Instead of complex rate limiting and enumeration prevention, we implemented a much simpler and more secure solution:

#### 1. **No Email Address Input**
- Users cannot enter different email addresses for resend
- Resend page only works with the original signup email
- Email address is passed securely via URL parameters from login attempt

#### 2. **Secure Email Flow**
```
1. User tries to login → 2. System detects unverified email
3. Login page shows "Resend" button → 4. Email passed via URL parameter
5. Resend page shows locked email → 6. User can only resend to their original email
```

#### 3. **McGill Email Validation**
- **Strict validation**: Only `@mail.mcgill.ca` and `@mcgill.ca` domains during signup
- **Institution control**: Limits to McGill community
- **No external targeting**: Impossible to send to non-McGill emails

### Key Security Principles Applied

#### **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Users can only resend emails to their own registered address
- No ability to specify arbitrary email addresses
- Email address locked to original signup

#### **Simplicity = Security**
- Simple solution with fewer attack vectors
- No complex rate limiting or enumeration prevention needed
- Easier to audit and maintain

#### **Defense by Design**
- Security built into the flow rather than added on top
- No way to abuse the system for harassment
- Inherently secure architecture

### Implementation Details

#### URL Parameter Security
```javascript
// Email passed via URL parameter from login page
const emailParam = searchParams.get('email')
// Only McGill emails allowed, validated during signup
```

#### User Flow Protection
- Resend page redirects to login if no email provided
- Email address displayed but not editable
- Clear messaging about security restrictions

### Benefits of This Approach

#### 1. **Eliminates Attack Vectors**
- No email enumeration possible
- No spam/harassment potential
- No rate limiting needed

#### 2. **Better User Experience**
- Clear, simple flow
- No confusing email input fields
- Obvious security messaging

#### 3. **Easier Maintenance**
- No complex server-side logic
- No rate limiting stores to manage
- Fewer potential bugs

### Production Recommendations

#### 1. **Email Security**
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC records for email authentication
- Monitor email deliverability
- Implement email reputation management

#### 2. **Additional Security Headers**
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Add security headers via middleware
- Use HTTPS in production

#### 3. **Monitoring**
- Log resend attempts for legitimate users
- Monitor email delivery success rates
- Alert on delivery failures

### Testing Security Measures

#### Test Cases
1. **Access resend page with valid email param** → Shows locked email, allows resend
2. **Access resend page without email param** → Redirects to login
3. **Try to modify email in URL** → Still only sends to original signup email
4. **Attempt resend for non-existent account** → Fails gracefully

#### Security Verification
- Verify email address cannot be changed
- Confirm redirects work for unauthorized access
- Test that only registered emails can resend
- Ensure no information disclosure

This simple, secure approach eliminates the complex attack vectors while providing a clean user experience for legitimate users needing to resend verification emails.
